        -- numpy.concatenate() allows you to concatenate two numpy arrays together
        -- numpy arrays are FAST; they use libraries originally written for supercomputers (c & fortran based)

pandas
    * pandas is used WITH numpy for easier digestion of data
    * when importing data, it automatically generates table-like structures similar to a DB Schema
    * Data Types
        -- Pandas tables (2d -- two dimensional data) are <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
        -- Pandas columns (1d -- one dimensional data) are <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
    * apply() method
        -- Panda apply() method takes a second argument which is 'axis'; this refers to the specific column to be used in the method
